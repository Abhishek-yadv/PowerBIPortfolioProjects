## Bank Loan Analysis

The Bank Loan Analysis project focuses on providing a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio. It encompasses the development of interactive dashboards that offer insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), loan performance metrics, regional analysis, and detailed loan data.

### Project Overview

This project involved the development of three main dashboards:

1. **Summary Dashboard**: Displays key KPIs such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. It also provides a breakdown of good and bad loans, along with a loan status grid view.

2. **Overview Dashboard**: Presents visualizations for monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term distribution, employee length analysis, loan purpose breakdowns, and home ownership insights.

3. **Details Dashboard**: Offers a comprehensive grid view of individual loan data, including purpose, home ownership status, grade, sub-grade, issue date, funded amount, interest rate, installment, and total amount received.

### Key Features

- Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
- Visualizations such as line charts, maps, donut charts, bar charts, and tree maps
- Detailed analysis of loan performance, regional trends, and borrower characteristics
- Insights and recommendations for improving lending practices and risk management
