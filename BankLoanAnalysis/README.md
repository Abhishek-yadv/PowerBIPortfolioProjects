# BankLoan Data Analysis üìà

## Objective: üéØ
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into loan portfolios, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Project Overview: üìä
This project involved the development of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using data analysis and visualization tools Power BI and Excel. The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing various loan-related details, enabling the extraction of valuable insights across three main dashboards.

### Dashboard 1: Summary üìù

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Loan Applications: Calculating the total number of loan applications received, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analyses.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers, analyzing MTD and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring MoM variations.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers, MTD, and tracking MoM fluctuations.

Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.
- Bad Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.

Loan Status Grid View: Providing a comprehensive overview of lending operations and loan performance, categorized by loan status, including metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.
