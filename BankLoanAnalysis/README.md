Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

Project Overview:
This project involved the development of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using data analysis and visualization tools like Power BI and Excel. The analysis was conducted on a dataset encompassing various loan-related attributes, enabling the extraction of valuable insights across three main dashboards.

Dashboard 1: Summary
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Loan Applications: Calculating the total number of loan applications received, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analyses.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers, analyzing MTD and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring MoM variations.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers, MTD, and tracking MoM fluctuations.

Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.
- Bad Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.

Loan Status Grid View: Providing a comprehensive overview of lending operations and loan performance, categorized by loan status, including metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

Dashboard 2: Overview
Charts:
1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Identifying seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Identifying regions with significant lending activity and assessing regional disparities.
3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understanding the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Assessing the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Providing a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes.
6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

Metrics shown: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
