# BankLoan Data Analysis üìà

## Objective: üéØ
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into loan portfolios, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Project Overview: üìä
This project involved the development of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using data analysis and visualization tools Power BI and Excel. The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing various loan-related details, enabling the extraction of valuable insights across three main dashboards.

### Dashboard 1: Summary üìù

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Loan Applications: Calculating the total number of loan applications received, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analyses.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers, analyzing MTD and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring MoM variations.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers, MTD, and tracking MoM fluctuations.

Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.
- Bad Loan: Application percentage, applications, funded amount, and total received amount.

Loan Status Grid View: Providing a comprehensive overview of lending operations and loan performance, categorized by loan status, including metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

Charts:
1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Identifying seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Identifying regions with significant lending activity and assessing regional disparities.
3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understanding the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Assessing the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Providing a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes.
6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

Metrics shown: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.

Grid: Providing a comprehensive view of all essential information within the loan data, offering a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points for efficient access to critical information.

Based on the provided images of the dashboards, here are some insights and recommendations:

## Insights:

### From Dashboard 1: Summary
1. **Loan Applications**: There were 38.6K total loan applications, showing a Month-over-Month (MoM) increase of 6.9%.
2. **Funded Amount and Amount Received**: The total funded amount is $435.8M, with a MoM increase of 13%. The total amount received is $473.1M, with a MoM increase of 15.8%.
3. **Interest Rate and DTI**: The average interest rate is 12.0%, with a slight MoM increase of 3.5%. The average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) is 13.3%, with a 2.7% MoM increase.
4. **Good vs. Bad Loans**: 86.2% of loans issued are considered good, totaling $370.2M in funded amounts, while 13.8% are bad loans, totaling $65.5M in funded amounts.
5. **Loan Status**: The grid shows a detailed breakdown of loan status categories, such as charged off, current, and fully paid, along with their respective metrics.

### From Dashboard 2: Overview
1. **Monthly Trends**: There is a noticeable upward trend in loan applications, with a peak in December.
2. **Regional Analysis**: Certain states show higher loan application volumes, indicating regional demand variations.
3. **Loan Term Distribution**: A majority of the loans (73.2%) are for 60 months, while 26.8% are for 36 months.
4. **Employee Length Analysis**: Applicants with 10+ years of employment history form the largest group, followed by those with less than one year.
5. **Loan Purpose**: Debt consolidation is the most common purpose for loans, followed by credit card refinancing and home improvement.
6. **Home Ownership**: Mortgage holders constitute a significant portion of the loan applicants compared to renters.

### From Dashboard 3: Details
1. **Detailed View**: The detailed grid provides comprehensive data on individual loans, including purpose, home ownership status, grade, sub-grade, issue date, funded amount, interest rate, installment, and total amount received.

## Recommendations:

### Enhanced Data Quality Measures:
1. **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Implement rigorous data validation and cleaning processes to ensure data accuracy and consistency, which will enhance the reliability of insights derived from the dashboards.

### From Dashboard 1: Summary
1. **Improve Loan Application Processes**: Considering the increase in loan applications, streamline the application process using automated systems to handle the growing volume efficiently.
2. **Interest Rate Strategy**: Evaluate and potentially adjust interest rate strategies to remain competitive while managing risk effectively, considering the slight increase in average interest rates.
3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio Monitoring**: Monitor the DTI closely to manage borrower risk and adjust lending criteria as necessary to maintain a healthy loan portfolio.

### From Dashboard 2: Overview
1. **Regional Marketing Efforts**: Focus marketing efforts on states with higher loan application volumes to capitalize on regional demand. Investigate and address factors contributing to lower performance in other regions.
2. **Loan Product Customization**: Customize loan products based on the identified preferences for loan terms and purposes. For example, develop targeted products for debt consolidation and home improvement loans.
3. **Employment-Based Risk Assessment**: Given the high number of applications from individuals with over ten years of employment, consider tailoring risk assessment models to leverage employment stability as a risk indicator.

### From Dashboard 3: Details
1. **Borrower Education Programs**: Develop educational programs to improve financial literacy among borrowers, helping them make informed decisions and potentially reducing delinquency rates.
2. **Risk-Based Pricing Strategies**: Implement risk-based pricing strategies to offer competitive rates to low-risk borrowers while adequately pricing higher-risk loans to cover potential losses.
3. **Detailed Monitoring and Analysis**: Use the detailed data to continuously monitor loan performance and borrower behavior, allowing for proactive adjustments in lending policies and practices.

By implementing these recommendations, the bank can enhance its loan portfolio performance, improve customer satisfaction, and achieve better financial outcomes.
