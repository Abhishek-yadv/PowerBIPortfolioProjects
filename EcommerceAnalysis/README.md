# ðŸ“Š eCommerce Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview:
The project aims to create an eCommerce sales dashboard for a US-based company, providing insightful information and visualizations to understand the business performance, identify opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement:
The eCommerce company wants to analyze their Year-to-Date (YTD) sales data and generate insights to address the following scenarios:

1. Create a KPI banner showcasing YTD Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Quantity sold, and YTD Profit Margin.
2. Analyze the Year-over-Year (YoY) growth for each KPI and display a YTD sparkline to understand the monthly trend for each measure.
3. Examine YTD Sales, Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) Sales, and YoY Sales growth for different customer categories, along with a trend icon for each category.
4. Evaluate YTD Sales performance by each state within the US.
5. Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales.
6. Analyze YTD Sales by region to determine the best and worst-performing regions across the country.
7. Assess YTD Sales by shipping type to identify the most effective shipping method.

## Insights:
1. The KPI banner provides a quick overview of the company's performance, showing a 1.93% decrease in YTD Sales, a 7.49% increase in YTD Profit, a 10.5% decrease in YTD Quantity, and an 11.35% increase in YTD Profit Margin.
2. The YoY Sales growth trend icons indicate that the Office Supplies category is performing well with a 5.23% growth, while the Furniture and Technology categories are struggling with a 3.23% and 1.20% decline, respectively.
3. The Sales by State map highlights the Central and East regions as the top-performing areas, while the West and South regions are lagging.
4. The top 5 products by YTD Sales are Easy-staple printer, Global Deluxe HL, Bretford Basics, Xerox 1983, and Xerox 1973, suggesting a demand for office supplies and technology products.
5. The bottom 5 products by YTD Sales are Fellowes Data d..., Eldonc Sure-D..., Wilbur Jones dr..., Eaton Expressio..., and Xerox 1973, indicating potential areas for product optimization or discontinuation.
6. The South region (18.68%) and West region (31.75%) are underperforming compared to the Central (23.13%) and East (26.34%) regions.
7. The Standard Class shipping type accounts for 60.9% of YTD Sales, followed by Second Class (24.5%) and First Class (15.57%), suggesting a potential opportunity to optimize shipping strategies.

## Recommendations:
1. Conduct a detailed analysis of the underperforming customer categories (Furniture and Technology) to identify root causes and develop targeted strategies to improve sales.
2. Evaluate the sales performance of individual products within the top and bottom 5 lists to make informed decisions about product promotions, discounts, or discontinuation.
3. Investigate the factors contributing to the lower sales performance in the South and West regions, such as market saturation, competition, or distribution challenges, and develop region-specific strategies to boost sales.
4. Review the shipping strategies and costs associated with each shipping type to optimize efficiency and potentially reduce costs without compromising customer experience.
5. Implement targeted marketing campaigns and promotions for the top-performing products and regions to capitalize on existing demand and drive further growth.
6. Consider diversifying the product portfolio by introducing new products or services based on market trends and customer feedback to drive sales and maintain a competitive edge.
